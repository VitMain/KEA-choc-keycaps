## About the KEA Profile
- The KEA profile keycaps are for Choc V1 switches, and are designed to be FDM printed. 
- The keycaps have a top and bottom chamfer on the backside to remove overhangs, and are meant to print standing up to align layer lines with the pins so that they do not fail in shear. 
- With small layer heights, the layer lines are almost invisible.

## Print Settings
I print these reliably on a Bambu Lab X1C, with a .4mm nozzle, with eSun PLA+. I find black looks the best as the layer lines are harder to see, however if you fine tune you can get them pretty invisible with any colour.

They are designed to be printed standing upright, as that gives the prongs optimal strength and avoid them breaking off in the switch.

My print settings are the following:
- Layer Height: .08mm
- Line Width: .42mm
- Wall Loops: 3
- Infill Density: 100%
- Speed: 20mm/s for everything
- Support: Painted manually, only under the keycap prongs
- Support Style: Snug
- Support top and bottom Z distance: .08mm
- Support top and bottom inferface layers: 2
- Brim: Yes
