## About the KEA Profile
The KEA profile keycaps are for Choc V1 switches, and are designed to be FDM printed. The keycaps have been designed to be 3D printed, featuring a top and bottom chamfer on the backside to remove overhangs, when printing standing up to increase strength, a bonus being that with small layer heights, the layer lines are almost invisible.
